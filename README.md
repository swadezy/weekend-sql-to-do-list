# Project Name

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a full CRUD to-do list app from scratch.  In order to do this, I had to set up a database, connect that database to a server, and connect that server to the client.  The most challenging pieces of this project was, believe it or not, getting the date received from the database to show on client in a slightly less gross way than the typical date object.  More exciting pieces of the project than the date logic were using sweetalert to create a popup confirmation for delete, and styling that shows whether a completed task was late or early.  I also was intentional with how the server handled data received from client to avoid SQL injection, and had a little bit of fun with some bootstrap styling to make it all look clean.
